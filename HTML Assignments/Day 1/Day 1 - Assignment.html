	<p><b>Web development</b> <i>refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites.</i> It includes aspects such as <i>web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.</i></p>

	<p>While the terms <a href="https://developers.google.com/web">"web developer"</a> and <a href="https://webdesigner.withgoogle.com/">"web designer"</a> are often used <b><i>synonymously</i></b>, they do not mean the same thing.
		<mark> Technically,a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP. Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.</mark></p>

	<p>Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/dreamweaver.html">Dreamweaver &trade;</a>, and updating a blog via a blogging website. <em>In recent years, content management systems like <mark><b><i>WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla</i></b></mark> have also become popular means of web development.</em> These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface.</p>

	<p>While there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicity">simplicity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customization">customization</a>. Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have a dedicated <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/learn/">Web development</a> team that designs and maintains the company's website(s). Small organizations and individuals are more <mark>likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic website template and simplified editing tools.</mark></p>

	<h2>NOTE:</h2>
	<p><small><mark><b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript programming</a></b> is a type of web development that is generally <b>not considered</b> part of web design.</mark> However, a web designer may reference JavaScript libraries like <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to incorporate dynamic elements into a site's design.</small></p>
